# System Theory (ST) or General System Theory (GST)

## Economics
* The economy works as a voting system for literally anything. Voting systems usually works well when individuals does not have contact with each other and can't influence each other's opinions (imagine rating YouTube videos or amazon products ratings). Although, in real life people DO influence each other's evaluation of the real price of a thing, this effect is more and less canceled out when we take the system as a whole, thus we arrive at usually "fair price" (not perfect due to the fact that people influence each other but quite fair).
