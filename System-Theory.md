# System Theory (ST) or General System Theory (GST)

## Economics
* The economy works as a voting system for literally anything. Voting systems usually works well when individuals does not have contact with each other and can't influence each other's opinions (imagine rating YouTube videos or amazon products ratings). Although, in real life people DO influence each other's evaluation of the real price of a thing, this effect is more and less canceled out when we take the system as a whole, thus we arrive at usually "fair price" (not perfect due to the fact that people influence each other but quite fair).

## Politics
* People have `agency` (i.e. the ability to make free choices). However, if a population are exposed to a restricted pool of choices for a long period of time, different people will make the same choices; they will share and influence each other's choices and over time will create a culture to justify and reinforce said choices. Thus, creating a repeatable and predictable pattern. So it is not `idealism` neither `materialism` that governs humans but both acting at the same time at different levels and functions and stages [source 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgOo-bS7OJI), [source 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgOo-bS7OJI).

* `Dominance` and `Hierarchy` happends via privilage `bargain powers` among individuos of a group and lack of equality counter ballance present in the system.

## Psychology
* The idea of `self` is constantly changing and molding depending on who we are speaking to (i.e.  evolving through social interactions and the ongoing construction of our identity) (Book: **Selfless: The Social Creation of “You”**) [source 1](https://bigthink.com/thinking/selfless-book/), [source 2](https://www.amazon.com.br/Selfless-Social-Creation-You-English-ebook).

* There is no `consciousness`. The phenomenon of consciousness emerges from our current perception of self and our perception of `continuality` through space and time. However, we do not observe our change of mind or attitude that are constantly being shaped through our social interactions and external events that leave long lasting memories on us. Thus, we are much like the `ship of theseus`, being rebuild and molded daily or hourly and although we think we are the same, we are indeed not. If you could go back in time and meet yourself from the past, you would not recognize yourself and neither your old-you would recognize you. Therefore, you are also a system and what constitute you is the sum of your interactions (with others and the world).
