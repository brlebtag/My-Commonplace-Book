# Testing
* DO NOT use a schema to test a code where you have a binary flag which will be later asserted already set to a value that pass the test. That's because if your test, for whatever reason, do not set the flag to an invalid state during the test when there was a problem, your test will pass even though it is clearly wrong. You must initiate a test with a value that will NOT pass the test and FORCE the test to set the flag to a valid state that passes the test. In other words, the default state of a test is `TEST FAILED` not `TEST PASSED`.
