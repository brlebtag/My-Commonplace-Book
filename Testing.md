# Testing
* DO NOT use a schema to test a code where you have a binary flag which will be later asserted already set to a value that pass the test. That's because if your test for whatever reason do not set the flag to a invalid test when there is a problem, your test will pass even though it is wrong. You must initiate a test with a value that it is not going to pass the test and the actual test must set the flag to a value that actually force the test to pass. In other words, the default state of a test is not pass all but fail all.
