## Wifi-Direct
* Android uses IP range for wifi direict 192.168.49.1/24. Group Owner is always 192.168.49.1 (it is hard-coded in the codebase). On the other hand. Windows uses 192.168.137.1/24. Group Owner is 192.168.137.1.
* Android limits in the code 5 Group Clients. Manufactures can change this value. Nothing prevents it. Android will randomly select IP fro Group clients. Windows seems to start backwards but it did not formed further.
