# Knowledge related to Troubleshooting

* Prefer to use the Scientific Method to troubleshooting:

**1. Observe the phenomenon and try to draw some conclusions**

a) What is there?

b) What is not there?

c) What is not there but should be there?

d) Should it really be there?

e) Is the data correct?

f) Is your analysis correct?

h) What you see it really what you see? Is it not what you want to see?

**2. Elicitate some questions regarding the phenomenon**

a) Why is not happening when it should?

b) Why is happening when it should not?

c) How is this happening?

d) When is this happening?

e) Where is this happening?

**3. Create some hypotheses that answer those questions**

**4. Create some tests to test the hypothesis**

a) How are you going to test it? => Create a precise methodology and follow it. _Checklists_ are useful.

b) How are you going to isolate the problem in the test so external events influence it?

c) How are you going to measure it? (pay attention to units)

d) Find the baseline of each measurement so you can separate data from noise (never compare the absolute values but the relative values (compared to something)).

**5. Execute the experiments**

a) Follow the methodology you created.

b) Pay attention if you're isolating properly the test from external factors. Isolate as much as possible the problem

c) Check if you're properly measuring it.

**6. Analysis the data and draw some conclusions**

a) Is data correct?

b) Did you measure it correctly?

c) Have you factored out as much external factors as possible?

c) What you see in the **data** is really what you see? Is it not what you **want to see**?

d) Does the data confirm or reject your hypotheses? Does it perfectly fit the hypotheses or something did not quite worked as expected?

f) How much did it diversed from the expectations? Just a little? too much? Is there some possibilities to explain this differences (do not always attribute to measurement or external factors, althoguh that will happen sometimes)

g) Are you excluding from the consideration the baseline/noise of the data?

**7. If hypothesis is proved and the problem is solved, you're done, otherwise, repeat step 1 based on observations from your tests**

# General Guidelines

* Always follows Occam's razor: "The simplest explanation is usually the best one (and correct one)".
* But also do not forget Sherlock Homes' saying: "When you have eliminated all which is impossible then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth".
* Work with deadlines: how much time are you going to allocate to test? to analysis the data? to repeat the tests? How much more are you going to keep testing?
* Doubt your yourself, doubt your reasoning, doubt what you're seeing, doubt the others, doubt the status quo, doubt group thinking, doubt the data, doubt the tests, doubt the measurements, doubt everything and everyone.
* Do **NOT** get attached to your opinions. Immediate discard them when they do not fit the data.
* Listen to others, ask help, get counselling from someone you trust
* Talk with someone though your reasoning, if you notice some wishful thinking or inability to explain something concise or properly, there is a problem in your knoledge
* Take breaks, see something different every onece in a while
* Know when to stop 
* Trust your gut feelings
* Doubt your gut feelings
* Be persistent and patient
