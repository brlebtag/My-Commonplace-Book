# Learning

## How To Learn Anything

* In order to learn anything, you must have three things: (i) `Time`, (ii) `A feeback loop` and (iii) `Incremental increase of complexity`. You won't be able to learn anything if one of them are missing.

### Time

* There is no way to learn something "fast". The reason for that is biological: It takes time for neurons formation and dendrite and axons to connect themselves. Another reason for that it is the fact that this process (establishing connection) is guided but largely random and thus, it cannot be speed up.

### Feedback loop
* You need to create a feeback loop proces: (i) You study/learn something, (ii) You try to apply what you learn, (iii) You analyze your results and correct any mistake you made, (iv) You apply to a third-party to evaluate your results and offer improvement suggestions, (v) You analyze the feedbacks and correct your mistakes, (vi) repeat step (i)

### Incremental increase of complexity
* You need to constantly and permanently expose yourself to more and more complexity. Never dwell the same stuffs for too long time, mainly when you feel everything is already too easy. Always try to swim in deep waters. Even when you have not already dominated everything in your current level. You will see that when you come back later, things will be easy and those stuffs you had problems before are not going to be a problem anymore.
